macro_builder.py

the program will take in a text file, and run the macro based on the lines written

how it will work:
  - looks at three different section
  - will execute the first part on startup
  - will repeatedly execute the middle part
    - until stopped
  - will safely end of the program

how writing these files will work:
  needs to:
  - have something to differentiate between the 3 sections
  - move to a given mouse coordinate
  - be able to wait for a duration of time
  - scroll for an amount
  - check screen color
  - drag mouse
